# book-webapp
An application to find new books to read and keep track of books you have read and wish to read in the future.

NOTE: For those that clone this, it's not possible for you to run this application because you do not have access to modify the database hosted on MongoDB atlas. Additionally, you will need to specify a private key and a Google Books API key. I will deploy this application eventually using Heroku, but feel free to look at the code if you would like.
